# Java Notes – My Learning Journey 🐒⚓️

Hey! I'm Yamina, and this is my personal stash of Java notes. Not written by a sensei or an all-knowing dev-god—these are student-made, messy-but-loveable notes created by someone *in the trenches*, still figuring stuff out one bug at a time.

These notes are built in **Obsidian-style markdown** — clean, linked, organized, and hella satisfying. If you also cry a little when `NullPointerException` hits you out of nowhere, you're in the right place.

## 🌊 Why This Repo Exists

Java is like the Grand Line of programming languages — huge, mysterious, sometimes terrifying, but also one of the most rewarding adventures in the programming world.

I'm learning Java as part of my Computer Science degree, and instead of letting notes rot in my local folders, I decided to share them here. I reference multiple textbooks, mix in real-world examples, and try to break things down the way *I wish* someone explained it to me.

> Whether you're a beginner or someone who just wants to refresh the basics, you're welcome to sail along on this coding voyage.

## 📚 Books That Guide My Voyage (a.k.a. My Log Pose)

1. **Java Programming Fundamentals**
   *Problem Solving Through Object Oriented Analysis and Design* by Premchand S. Nair
   — An oldie but goldie. Great for learning how to think like a programmer and understand the deeper design side of Java. Not flashy, but solid.

2. **Java: The Complete Reference, Eleventh Edition** by Herbert Schildt
   — This is the *One Piece* of Java books: massive, legendary, and shockingly readable. Covers everything from basic syntax to advanced topics. If I had to take only one book to Raftel, it’d be this one.

3. **Beginning Programming with Java for Dummies**
   — Super beginner-friendly. Uses analogies, simple terms, and walks you through stuff like you’re five.

4. **Java for Dummies**
   — A more advanced follow-up to the previous one. Dives deeper into intermediate topics. If "Beginning Programming" is East Blue, this one is Alabasta and beyond.

5. **Java: An Introduction to Problem Solving & Programming** (International Edition, Pearson)
   — A well-balanced, problem-solving focused book that makes you write code *and* understand what the heck you're doing. Solid CS fundamentals.

## 📂 What You'll Find Inside This Treasure Chest

* Fully **markdown-formatted** notes from my Obsidian vault
* Organized by topic and chapter for smooth navigation
* Clear explanations of:

  * Variables, Data Types
  * Control Structures (`if`, `while`, `for`, etc.)
  * Classes & Objects
  * Inheritance & Polymorphism
  * Arrays & Collections
  * Exception Handling
  * File I/O
* Code blocks with syntax highlighting
* Real-world examples and "why this matters" takes
* Mini-challenges to test understanding (aka mini boss fights)

> Think of these notes as my own little programming grimoire. Use them, remix them, fork them. Just don’t let them sit untouched like the Poneglyphs.

## 🌍 Quick Java Intro (in case you're just starting)

Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). It's used for building:

* Desktop applications
* Mobile apps (esp. Android)
* Web backends
* Enterprise-level software

Its secret sauce? The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** that allows you to run the same code on any machine. "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) is the battle cry!

If you're new, Java is great because:

* It teaches you solid coding discipline
* It's strict but logical (forces good habits)
* It’s everywhere: banks, games, enterprise, Android apps

## 🎃 Final Words from the Deck

This repo is for learners, dreamers, note-lovers, and future software pirates. If you find any typos or bugs, let me know or submit a pull request — collaboration makes the ship sail faster.

Let’s level up together. From East Blue (basic syntax) to Wano (advanced OOP), one commit at a time.
